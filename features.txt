fullfils the following:

- get adjusted times for each rider for a given stage (a list of times, sorted by time)
- be able to get riders finishing positions for a given stage (a list of riderIDs sorted by their times)
- get a list of riders points, sorted by elapsed time. within a stage
- get a list of mountain points, sorted by finish time (elapsed time). within stage
- remove stage results from a rider. (from both the rider and stage end and segments)

- register rider results in stage.
